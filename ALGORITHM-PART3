# Algorithm Simulator - PART 3

Our "Secret Sauce" - A sophisticated algorithm that automatically redistributes income across financial priorities.

## ðŸ¤– Algorithm Overview

This JavaScript algorithm is the core intelligence of your personal finance automation app. It takes a paycheck amount and intelligently distributes it across your financial goals based on priority levels.

## Features

###  **Core Algorithm**
- **Automatic Distribution**: Takes any paycheck amount and redistributes it
- **Priority-Based Allocation**: Essential > High > Medium > Low priority
- **Flexible Rules**: Easy to customize allocation percentages
- **Smart Balancing**: Ensures 100% distribution with rounding precision

###  **Advanced Features**
- **Custom Allocation Rules**: Define your own categories and percentages
- **Goal-Based Optimization**: Uses your expense data to create personalized rules
- **Real-time Calculation**: Instant results as you type
- **Visual Breakdown**: Clear table showing category, amount, and percentage

###  **Integration**
- **React Component**: Full UI integration with the data entry app
- **Data Persistence**: Uses existing expense data for personalization
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## Algorithm Rules

### Default Allocation (50-30-20 Rule)
```javascript
{
  essential: {
    name: "Essential Bills",
    percentage: 50,
    priority: "essential"
  },
  savings: {
    name: "Savings & Emergency Fund",
    percentage: 30,
    priority: "high"
  },
  discretionary: {
    name: "Discretionary Spending",
    percentage: 20,
    priority: "medium"
  }
}
```

### Custom Allocation (Based on Your Goals)
The algorithm analyzes your expense data and creates personalized rules:
- **Essential**: 40-60% (rent, utilities, food, minimum debt)
- **High Priority**: 20-40% (savings, important goals)
- **Medium Priority**: 10-25% (entertainment, hobbies)
- **Low Priority**: 5-15% (nice-to-have items)

## How It Works

### 1. Input Processing
```javascript
// Example: $5000 paycheck
const paycheckAmount = 5000;
const allocations = distributePaycheck(paycheckAmount);
```

### 2. Distribution Calculation
```javascript
// Results:
[
  { category: "Essential Bills", amount: 2500, percentage: 50 },
  { category: "Savings", amount: 1500, percentage: 30 },
  { category: "Discretionary", amount: 1000, percentage: 20 }
]
```

### 3. Advanced Personalization
```javascript
// Uses your expense data to create custom rules
const customRules = createBalancedAllocation(expenseData, paycheckAmount);
const personalizedAllocations = distributePaycheck(paycheckAmount, customRules);
```

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `distributePaycheck(amount, rules)`
Distributes a paycheck amount according to allocation rules.

**Parameters:**
- `amount` (number): The paycheck amount to distribute
- `rules` (object): Optional custom allocation rules

**Returns:** Array of allocation objects
```javascript
[
  {
    id: "essential",
    category: "Essential Bills",
    amount: 2500,
    percentage: 50,
    priority: "essential"
  }
]
```

#### `createBalancedAllocation(goals, totalIncome)`
Creates optimized allocation rules based on financial goals.

**Parameters:**
- `goals` (array): Array of expense/goal objects
- `totalIncome` (number): Total income for percentage calculation

#### `formatCurrency(amount)`
Formats amount as currency string.

#### `validateAllocationRules(rules)`
Validates that allocation rules sum to 100%.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
import { distributePaycheck, DEFAULT_ALLOCATION_RULES } from './utils/financeAlgorithm';

const paycheck = 4000;
const breakdown = distributePaycheck(paycheck);
// Returns: Essential: $2000, Savings: $1200, Discretionary: $800
```

### Custom Rules
```javascript
const customRules = {
  rent: { name: "Rent", percentage: 40, priority: "essential" },
  food: { name: "Food", percentage: 25, priority: "essential" },
  savings: { name: "Savings", percentage: 20, priority: "high" },
  entertainment: { name: "Entertainment", percentage: 15, priority: "medium" }
};

const breakdown = distributePaycheck(3000, customRules);
```

### React Integration
```jsx
import AlgorithmSimulator from './components/AlgorithmSimulator';

function App() {
  return (
    <AlgorithmSimulator expenseData={expenseData} />
  );
}
```

## UI Components

### AlgorithmSimulator Component
- **Paycheck Input**: Form to enter paycheck amount
